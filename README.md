# Digital Witch Project viz

This repo contains some additional visualizations for the [Digital Witch Project](https://www.digitalpitchproject.org).

These are constructed with d3.js and lots of love! The charts all depict a primary film (one of six) with the word frequency compared to a secondary film (generally one of 73). The top results are only words that the two have in common.

The stop word list comes from http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/ .
